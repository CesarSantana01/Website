# Website

This is my personal website showcasing some of my skills and abilities. This is by no means everything that I am capable of, but instead it is a little view into my coding methodology. I built this site using plain HTML, CSS, and javascript with an emphasis on the React Library. Tools such as webpack and babel allow for a better user experience and overall navigation. Finally with the use of Packages (NPM) I am able to save time by using prebuilt, tested code.
